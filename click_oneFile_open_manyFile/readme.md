# ❔Identifying the Task

I have school responsibility at Day time and I do self-taught at Night Time. And Every time I work on myself for `learning new things` or `grinding on myself`. I open →

- `Chrome` → To research my problem and to glean some ideas for working on my solutions.
- `Notion` → to write down my lessons and understanding the topics.
- `Streamabs` → to document my lessons.
- `File explorer` → to check my recorded vids and to navigate to files and folders.

# ‼️The problem

however, clicking each desktop application takes a chunk of minutes of my time. I want to boost my productivity and utilize all of my time and to mitigate waiting time. 

# ❓Task

I want to create an automation and create a file wherein if I click the file. it will open up those 4 applications to boost productivity.

# 📝Activity 1

Do the Task. but since I am in our computer library. my access to the computer is limited. so rather than opening `Chrome`, `Notion`, `Streamlabs`, and `Fire Explorer`. As a substitute. The task is to create a script file where in it will open up these Desktop Application simultaneously instead :

- `Microsoft word`
- `notepad`
- `internet explorer`
- `fire explorer`
