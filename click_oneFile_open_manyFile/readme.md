# Identifying the Task

every day if i work on working on myself for javascript. i open:

- Chrome → and open up freecodecamp
- Notion → to write down my lessons
- Streamabs → to record my lessons
- File explorer → to check my recorded vids

# Task

I want to create an automation and create a file wherein if I click the file. it will open up those 4 applications to boost productivity.

# 📝Activity 1

Do the Task. but since you’re in a computer library. your access to the computer is limited. so rather than opening Chrome, Notion, streamlabs, and Fire Explorer. as a substitute. create a script file wherein it will open up these simultaneously :

- Microsoft word -> for your schoolwork
- notepad -> where you take notes
- internet explorer -> for research regarding your schoolwork
- file explorer -> to navigate your file location
