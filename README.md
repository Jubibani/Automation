### Why Did I Make Quickie Automation?

 Whether I go to class or learn from home, I have to open up and log in again to certain sites for my needed tools which is quite a hassle especially when going to school! —so I made `"Quickie"` 

- I reckon, It would be best to leave repetitive tasks to automation to be able to do more important things, save time, and be productive.

QUICKIE `POWERSHELL` SCRIPT FILE OR `QUICKIEPOW`

this version of Quickie is more powerful. 

- it has a password before logging in.
- incognito enabled.
- made with powershell with selenium (more suitable with web automation)

a common example is in college. where one computer is used by many users.


they are both `Quickie` → but differentiated by usage. though i use both, i still prefer the version `QuickiePow` since i use it at my university where many other students also use my computer unit.
