# `Meet Cleanie And Quickie`

- `"Cleanie"` is a `bat. file` that cleans your computer’s unnecessary files if executed.
- `"Quickie"` is also a `bat. file` but opens up your Chrome web page with your necessary sites. making you work-ready and boosting your productivity.

# `Why make this?`

- Working is a hobby of mine but I also have leisure to play games. that’s when I need to clean and delete the trash from `temp`, `%temp%`, and `prefetch`, and then delete it again from the `recycle bin`. — which is a hassle so I made `"Cleanie"`.
- Whether I go to class or learn from home, I have to open up and log in again to certain sites for my needed tools which is quite a hassle especially when going to school! —so I made `"Quickie"`

I reckon it would be best to leave repetitive tasks to automation to be able to do more important things, save time, and be productive.
