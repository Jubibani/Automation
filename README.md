### Why Did I Make Quickie Automation?

 Whether I go to class or learn from home, I have to open up and log in again to certain sites for my needed tools which is quite a hassle especially when going to school! —so I made `"Quickie"` 

- I reckon, It would be best to leave repetitive tasks to automation to be able to do more important things, save time, and be productive.
